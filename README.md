In this assignment we were tasked to create a webform using more advanced HTML/CSS and Javascript. The focus was to give feedback to the user (UX practice) to make the form feel more interactive and clear when filling out. This includes producing error messages when an input field has an incorrect value submitted from the user and other things such as a helper icon for each input.
